                <h3>„Future Nostalgia“ </h3>
                    <p> The project by Nadja Kracunovic (Initiator), Denis Lee, Dean Ruddock and David Bilek, was presented as a radio Show „Future       Nostalgia Fm“, aa installations called „Eavesdropshop“ and „Futorology Kiosk“, and as an internet sensation „futurenostalgia.digital“. </p>
                        „Future Nostalgia Fm“: is an experimental, imaginary radio station, combining speculative storytelling, poems, sounds, and audios that overlap eras - from the distant past to the possible future. Its narrative wavers between speculations, aspirations, alternative versions, and perspectives of reality. Future Nostalgia FM as a sound piece was exhibited on the walls of the Footnote center in Belgrade, Serbia as a unique, nostalgic experience, as well as played on the Theaterplatz within the Kultursymposium Weimar 2021. </p>
                        „Eavesdropshop“: The walls of the Stasi (Staatssicherheitsdienst — State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic, GDR) building in Leipzig are invaded by a fictional inventory. Lavishly displayed in a newly opened, sui generis shop, the objects are meant to be used for hearing the sound of the future, nostalgia, and social dreaming, coming out of the walls. </p>
                        „Futorology Kiosk“: Settled in a small GDR kiosk that was used for the newspaper's distribution in Eastern Germany, the Futurology kiosk presents a distortion of our timeline, where past, present, and future suddenly collided. Combining multiple mediums, sound, installation, and performative objects, its futuristic experience unsettles the present and speculates on the future through its conceptual inventory - imaginatively designed broken ceramics. The artifacts are excavations from the future bringing nostalgia for what has never happened.</p> 
                        „futurenostalgia.digital“: Future Nostalgia FM is a digital, experimental, imaginary radio, combining speculative storytelling, poems, sounds, and audios that overlap eras - from the distant past to the possible future. Its nostalgic but futuristic content has a narrative that wavers between imagination, aspirations, and human interactions while offering alternative versions and perspectives of reality. </p>

                <h3>„Schlosserzählen #3“</h3>
                <p>The radio artists Eunike Kramer and David Bilek contribute to the urban outdoor space with their audio installation, offering various perspectives on the palace and its history. Passersby on the streets of Weimar associate different impressions with the Residenzschloss. For some, the palace at the park entrance resembles an unopened black box. Others have personal memories of the building, knowing about rooms in the palace and events that have taken place there. Their memories illustrate an auditory tour of the palace, traversing the many layers of time inscribed within it. Their expressions are accompanied by a composition of sounds from the palace itself. Arriving in the present, the palace also demands a critical stance: Must we preserve our symbols of authority? And whose version of the past should be told in the present?  The audio installation can be heard daily in the passage to the courtyard of the city palace as well as on the project website .</p>
